Description: Various functions developed at the Department of Biostatistics,
             Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute,
             University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.
             Currently implemented topics:
             several CI's for proportions,
             Fagan-Nomogram,
             bootstrap CI's for the kappa coefficient,
             intraclass-correlation coefficients including CI's,
             agreement for continuous measurements (Bland-Altman plot),
             CI for the area under the curve (AUC),
             Mantel-Haenszel estimator,
             Mantel-Cox hazard ratio estimator,
             CI for the Kaplan-Meier estimate at given time points,
             CI for quantile of a Kaplan-Meier or cumulative incidence estimate,
             sample size computations for two-sample Mann-Whitney test,
             McNemar test,
             binary diagnostic test (via normal approximation and simulation),
	     natural re-parametrization of Weibull output from survreg,
             hazard ratio and event time ratio interpretations,
             a plot to check the adequacy of the Weibull model.
